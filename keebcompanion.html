      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        KeebCompanion is a personal collection of web applications that serve as
        useful tools for those in the mechanical keyboard hobby. This collection
        was created in February 2023 to apply my knowlege of MySQL after
        completing a course on this language. These applications follow a
        RESTful design pattern and utilize local MySQL databases.

      <p>
        KeebCompanion consists of two web applications:
        <i>KeebCollection</i> and <i>KeebTimer</i>. These applications were
        created after being unable to find tools that completely satisfied my
        needs in the mechanical keyboard hobby. The remainder of this page
        covers brief descriptions of the two applications. To learn more about
        these applications, please visit the GitHub repository linked at the
        bottom of the page.

      <p>
        KeebCollection is the first tool in the KeebCompanion collection. This
        tool allows users to store their collection of various mechanical
        keyboard parts. The tool features the create, read, update, and delete
        (CRUD) operations while also providing statistics for the items added.

      <p>
        KeebTimer is the second tool in the KeebCompanion collection. This tool
        is both a timer and a counter that allows users to manage their time
        spent performing mechanical keyboard related tasks. Users can also store
        their timer and counter values for each task.

      <h2 style="margin-top: 60px">My Role in the Project</h2>
      <p>
        KeebCompanion is a project that I created and developed entirely by
        myself. Each of the applications follow a RESTful design pattern. Below
        is a brief explanation of the implementation and technologies used in
        each of the two tools.
      </p>

      <h2 class="app-titles">REST API:</h2>
      <p>
        Each of the two tools in KeebCompanion utilize a REST API as a bridge
        between the user (client) and database (server) sides of the
        application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>client</i> side of the applications consists of the user
        interfaces that are displayed during use. Certain pages on these
        interfaces display dynamic values that are fetched from a database using
        the REST API. There are buttons on these interfaces that call the REST
        API to modify the database as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <i>server</i> side of the applications is a web server that receives
        the results of the REST API calls. These results are from various POST,
        GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods that are called for each of the CRUD
        operations when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        More information on these REST APIs can be viewed in the 'index.js' file
        of the 'server' directories for each the two tools in the KeebCompanion
        GitHub repository. Here are the links to this file for
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jal004/KeebCompanion/blob/main/KeebCollection/server/index.js"
          target="_blank"
          >KeebCollection</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jal004/KeebCompanion/blob/main/KeebTimer/server/index.js"
          target="_blank"
          >KeebTimer.</a
        >
      </p>

      <h2 class="app-titles">MySQL:</h2>
      <p>
        The two tools use MySQL to store user data and return specific queries
        for the user to view. Each of the tools automatically create the
        required database and tables in MySQL during their initializations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tables for both of the tools use primary keys to distinguish rows of
        user data. Additionally, KeebTimer features an second table with a
        foreign key in order to implement a one-to-many relationship for this
        application. The queries utilize aggregate and window functions as well
        as joins to extract specific information on the user data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since these MySQL operations are executed by the REST API, information
        on the MySQL database schemas and queries can also be seen in the
        'index.js' file of the 'server' directories for each the two tools in
        the KeebCompanion GitHub repository.
      </p>

      <h2 class="app-titles">Express:</h2>
      <p>
        Express is the framework that is used to define each of the requests in
        the REST APIs of the two tools. In other words, Express is used to
        create the REST APIs described above for each application.
      </p>

      <h2 class="app-titles">React:</h2>
      <p>
        React is a JavaScript library that is responsible for the user
        interfaces of each application. All of the pages in both tools are
        "React arrow function components". These pages utilize the Axios NPM
        package to send requests to the REST API from the client side.
        Additionally, React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef are
        used to dynamically restore previously existing states for certain
        pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        More information on these pages can be viewed in the files of the
        'client/src/pages' directory for each the two tools in the KeebCompanion
        GitHub repository. Here are the links to these directories for
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jal004/KeebCompanion/tree/main/KeebCollection/client/src/pages"
          target="_blank"
          >KeebCollection</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jal004/KeebCompanion/tree/main/KeebTimer/client/src/pages"
          target="_blank"
          >KeebTimer.</a
        >
      </p>

      <h2 class="app-titles">Node:</h2>
      <p>
        Node is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript. In other words,
        Node serves as the foundation for all backend logic in the applications.
        This includes the REST APIs created by Express. Additionally, Node is
        used to install specific packages through the Node Package Manager
        (NPM). These packages contain functions that are necessary in developing
        both the client and server sides of the application.
