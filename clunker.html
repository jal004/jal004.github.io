      <p>
        The Clunker is a 40% keyboard with a knob and a solenoid manufactured by
        MechWild. The 40% is a layout that consists of only the alphabetical and
        some of the "modifier" (Space, Shift, Enter, etc.) keys. One key feature
        of 40% keyboards is that they usually do not have a number key row. If
        it is present, then it is only half of the row as seen in the layout of
        the Clunker below.

        The mounting style of the BM65 is known as a "top" mount, meaning that
        the plate is secured to only the top-half of the case. This mounting
        style offers a stiffer typing experience compared to other mounts.

        The Clunker is sold as a kit consisting of a blank PCB and various
        components that are to be soldered onto it. Custom mechanical keyboards
        are not typically sold like this, and often arrive with PCBs that have
        all of their components already soldered. However, the Clunker is a
        small project that was coordinated by several people, rather than a
        corporation or factory. Selling the kits this way greatly reduces the
        cost and labor which is also reflected in its final retail price.

        Additionally, the components to solder onto the PCB are "through-hole",
        meaning that the devices have legs that are passed through the sockets
        of the PCB when soldered and cut once the joints are made behind the
        PCB. These components are not common among the majority of keyboards
        which use "surface-mount" components that are soldered to the front, or
        surface, of the PCB.

        The PCB has also been made "hotswappable" by soldering 0305 Mill-Max
        sockets in each of the switch sockets. This allows for switches to be
        installed and uninstalled by simply inserting the switches into the PCB
        as opposed to soldering and desoldering them.

        The name "Clunker" is an informal reference to old cars, as the use of
        solenoids can be seen in both cars and old-fashioned keyboards.
        Solenoids were primarily used in IBM typewriters in order to prevent the
        activation of multiple keys at the same time, and they are responsible
        for the "ticking" noise that typewriters make when typing. During the
        transition from typewriters to keyboards, the first few IBM keyboards,
        such as the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT9CHub9Cxs" target="_blank"
          >IBM 5251</a
        >, featured a solenoid whose sole purpose was to make the same noise as
        a typewriter so that people could transition from typewriters to
        keyboards easier. The solenoid in the Clunker serves the same purpose as
        the IBM 5251, but uses a smaller solenoid. This results in a higher
        pitched sound that is closer to a typewriter while also providing haptic
        feedback with each keypress.

        The stabilizer foam pads are thin pads that are place between each of
        the stabilizer slots. This foam dampens the sound of the stabilizer when
        it makes contact with the PCB during a keypress.

      <!-- Review -->
      <h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Personal Review</h2>
      <p>
        The Clunker is a keyboard that packs many unique features into an
        extremely small form factor while also being affordable. The solenoid is
        a fun feature that I enjoy using even though it can be loud at times.
        The knob is another useful feature that slightly helps with adding more
        functionality to its minimal layout. However, the compactness of a 40%
        keyboard constantly reminds me how much I take certain keys for granted.
